By clicking the "New Customer" option, the user can register in the system and apply for a credit. When the user is registered to the system customer information is received.

The credit score service is assumed to be written before according the their income, and the credit score of the relevant person is taken and the credit result and credit limit are shown to the user.

If the user clicks on the "Registered Customer" option, they can update their income, assurance and phone number information and apply for a credit. If the customer has an approved credit application, the system will not approve it again.

After the user clicks on the "Check Credit Results" option, they can view the credit results with their ID number and date of birth. If the date of birth and the ID number do not match, the user will not be able to see the credit results.
